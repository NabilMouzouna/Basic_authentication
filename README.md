# Simple JavaFX Authentication System with MySQL

This is a simple JavaFX project implementing a basic authentication system with MySQL database integration. The project consists of three main scenes: login, signup, and home.

## Features

- **Login**: Users can log in with their email and password. If the credentials are correct, they are redirected to the home page.
- **Signup**: New users can create an account by providing their full name, email, and password.
- **Home**: Upon successful login or signup, users are redirected to the home page, where they can access their profile information and perform other actions.

## Technologies Used

- JavaFX: For building the user interface and handling user interactions.
- MySQL: For storing user data such as email, password, and full name.
- JDBC: For connecting Java application with the MySQL database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
 git clone https://github.com/NabilMouzouna/Basic_authentication.git
```

2. Set up MySQL database:

- Create a MySQL database and a table to store user data. You can use the following SQL script as a reference:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      fullname VARCHAR(100),
      email VARCHAR(100),
      password VARCHAR(100)
  );
  ```

3. Configure database connection:

- Update the MySQL connection settings in the Java code to match your database configuration.

4. Build and run the project:

- Open the project in your favorite Java IDE.
- Build and run the project to launch the JavaFX application.

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. If you are a new user, click on the "Signup" button to create an account.
3. If you already have an account, enter your email and password and click on the "Login" button.
4. Upon successful authentication, you will be redirected to the home page.

## Notes

- This is a simple authentication system and does not implement advanced security measures such as encryption or authorization management. Use it for educational or prototyping purposes only.
- Ensure to handle exceptions and edge cases appropriately, especially when dealing with user input and database operations.
- Contributions and feedback are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests to improve the project.
